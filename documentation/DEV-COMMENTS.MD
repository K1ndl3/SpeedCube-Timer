### 2) Left Side-bar
- Has **2 subcomponents:**

  #### a) The 4 Main Stats
  - Best overall single
  - Current Ao3
  - Current Ao5
  - Current Ao12

  #### b) Detailed Stats

  - Shows Ao100
  - Ability to click on a solve to see details:
    - Time of solve
    - Scramble of the solve
    - Time/date of the solve
    - Any comments

### 3) Main Timer Display
- Shows the timer
- Shows the scramble
- Buttons underneath for:
  - DNF (Did Not Finish)
